## Step 2: GitHub Pages Custom Domain Setup

### Method 1: Using GitHub Interface (Easiest)

1. **Deploy to GitHub Pages first:**
   ```bash
   # In your project folder
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/placer-forest-school.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch" ‚Üí main
   - Wait for initial deployment

3. **Add Custom Domain:**
   - Still in Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Under "Custom domain", enter: `placerforestschool.com`
   - Check "Enforce HTTPS" (recommended)
   - Click Save

4. **GitHub creates CNAME file automatically**

### Method 2: Manual CNAME File

Create this file in your project root:

**File: `/CNAME`** (no extension)
```
placerforestschool.com
```

Then commit and push:
```bash
git add CNAME
git commit -m "Add custom domain"
git push
```

## Step 3: Configure DNS at Your Domain Registrar

```
Type: A
Host: @ (or leave blank)

Type: A  
Host: @ (or leave blank)
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Host: @ (or leave blank) 
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A
Host: @ (or leave blank)

```

### For WWW Subdomain (www.placerforestschool.com):

**Add CNAME Record:**
```
Type: CNAME
Host: www
Value: YOUR_USERNAME.github.io
```

## Step 4: Wait for DNS Propagation

  "url": "https://placerforestschool.com"
}
```
