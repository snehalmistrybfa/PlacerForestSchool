          "question": "What is forest school?",
          "answer": "Forest school is a child-centered educational approach that takes place in natural outdoor environments. Children engage in hands-on learning through exploration, play, and discovery in nature, developing confidence, independence, and a deep connection to the natural world."

Older children develop leadership and empathy, while younger ones bring creativity, curiosity, and fresh perspective. Together, they create a dynamic environment where diverse developmental stages and interests are supported through collaboration and play."

        },
        {
          "question": "What is your supervision ratio?",
          "answer": "We maintain a low adult-to-child ratio to ensure proper supervision while allowing for independent exploration. Specific ratios depend on group size and activities."

        },
        {
          "question": "What activities do children do?",

        {
          "question": "Do you provide structured lessons?",
