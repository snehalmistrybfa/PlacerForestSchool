                <div class="content-grid">
                    <div class="content-text">
                        <p>At Placer Forest School, we believe that children learn best when they are free to explore, discover, and connect with the natural world. Our philosophy is rooted in the understanding that nature provides the perfect classroom for developing resilience, creativity, and a deep sense of wonder.</p>
                        
                        <p>We embrace the principles of respectful parenting, recognizing each child as a unique individual with their own timeline for growth and learning. Our approach honors children's innate wisdom and supports their natural development through unstructured play and authentic experiences.</p>
                        
                        <p>Through regular immersion in nature, children develop not only academic skills but also emotional intelligence, problem-solving abilities, and a lifelong love of learning that extends far beyond the forest.</p>

                        <p>We follow the traditional forest school approach, originating in Scandinavia, where children spend their days outdoors regardless of weather. This builds resilience, confidence, and a deep connection to nature.</p>
